# Crossref Five-Chain Docker Experiment

This directory starts five isolated `crossrefd` chains and one Hermes relayer.
Hermes opens a full mesh of `crossref` IBC channels between:

- `chain-a <-> chain-b`
- `chain-a <-> chain-c`
- `chain-a <-> chain-d`
- `chain-a <-> chain-e`
- `chain-b <-> chain-c`
- `chain-b <-> chain-d`
- `chain-b <-> chain-e`
- `chain-c <-> chain-d`
- `chain-c <-> chain-e`
- `chain-d <-> chain-e`

The resulting network has 10 pairwise IBC channels and 20 directed
cross-reference paths.

## Directed Route Numbers

IBC channel IDs are local to each chain, so several chains can each have their
own `channel-0`. For logs and visual inspection, the experiment assigns one
global directed route number to every path:

| Route | Direction | Actual local endpoint | Actual counterparty endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `route-00` | `chain-a -> chain-b` | `chain-a/channel-0` | `chain-b/channel-0` |
| `route-01` | `chain-b -> chain-a` | `chain-b/channel-0` | `chain-a/channel-0` |
| `route-02` | `chain-a -> chain-c` | `chain-a/channel-1` | `chain-c/channel-0` |
| `route-03` | `chain-c -> chain-a` | `chain-c/channel-0` | `chain-a/channel-1` |
| `route-04` | `chain-a -> chain-d` | `chain-a/channel-2` | `chain-d/channel-0` |
| `route-05` | `chain-d -> chain-a` | `chain-d/channel-0` | `chain-a/channel-2` |
| `route-06` | `chain-a -> chain-e` | `chain-a/channel-3` | `chain-e/channel-0` |
| `route-07` | `chain-e -> chain-a` | `chain-e/channel-0` | `chain-a/channel-3` |
| `route-08` | `chain-b -> chain-c` | `chain-b/channel-1` | `chain-c/channel-1` |
| `route-09` | `chain-c -> chain-b` | `chain-c/channel-1` | `chain-b/channel-1` |
| `route-10` | `chain-b -> chain-d` | `chain-b/channel-2` | `chain-d/channel-1` |
| `route-11` | `chain-d -> chain-b` | `chain-d/channel-1` | `chain-b/channel-2` |
| `route-12` | `chain-b -> chain-e` | `chain-b/channel-3` | `chain-e/channel-1` |
| `route-13` | `chain-e -> chain-b` | `chain-e/channel-1` | `chain-b/channel-3` |
| `route-14` | `chain-c -> chain-d` | `chain-c/channel-2` | `chain-d/channel-2` |
| `route-15` | `chain-d -> chain-c` | `chain-d/channel-2` | `chain-c/channel-2` |
| `route-16` | `chain-c -> chain-e` | `chain-c/channel-3` | `chain-e/channel-2` |
| `route-17` | `chain-e -> chain-c` | `chain-e/channel-2` | `chain-c/channel-3` |
| `route-18` | `chain-d -> chain-e` | `chain-d/channel-3` | `chain-e/channel-3` |
| `route-19` | `chain-e -> chain-d` | `chain-e/channel-3` | `chain-d/channel-3` |

## Build

Build the Linux ARM64 daemon used by the Docker image:

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o ./build/crossrefd-linux-arm64 ./cmd/crossrefdd
```

## Start

Start all five chains and the relayer:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

The relayer container runs `setup-ibc.sh`, which waits for all chains, imports
Hermes keys, and creates the full mesh of `crossref` channels.

## Run the Experiment

Run the end-to-end five-chain experiment:

```bash
docker/scripts/run-crossref-experiment.sh
```

The script performs these checks:

1. Prints the `route-00` to `route-19` numbering table.
2. Waits for all 20 directed `crossref` channel endpoints.
3. Registers all five domains on all five chains.
4. Binds every directed domain/channel route.
5. Submits one checkpoint on each source chain.
6. Queries each source checkpoint with an ICS23 store proof using
   `query crossref checkpoint-proof`.
7. Updates the destination light clients to the source proof heights.
8. Broadcasts each source checkpoint packet to the other four chains.
9. Verifies that every destination chain stores cross-references for the other
   four source chains.

Success ends with:

```text
Five-chain cross-reference experiment passed.
```

## Hysteresis Signature Verification

Domains can register an Ed25519 `hysteresis_public_key`. When this key is set,
`SubmitCheckpoint` and IBC packet receive both require `hysteresis_signature` to
verify against the checkpoint hash. Domains without a registered public key are
accepted for local experiments and migration compatibility.

## Endpoints

| Chain | RPC | gRPC | REST |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | `http://localhost:26657` | `localhost:9090` | `http://localhost:1317` |
| B | `http://localhost:26667` | `localhost:9091` | `http://localhost:1318` |
| C | `http://localhost:26677` | `localhost:9092` | `http://localhost:1319` |
| D | `http://localhost:26687` | `localhost:9093` | `http://localhost:1320` |
| E | `http://localhost:26697` | `localhost:9094` | `http://localhost:1321` |

## Reset

Stop containers and remove all chain state:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

## Notes

`run-crossref-experiment.sh` assumes the channel and client IDs produced by the
channel creation order in `setup-ibc.sh`. If the full-mesh channel order changes,
update `channel_id()` and `client_for_source()` in the experiment script.

The script leaves the Docker network running after a successful experiment so
that query commands and visual inspection can continue.
