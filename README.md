# Crossref Five-Chain IBC

Crossref Five-Chain IBC is a Cosmos SDK prototype for a cross-reference blockchain system. It implements a custom `x/crossref` module, exposes it as an IBC application module, and includes a Docker-based five-chain experiment driven by one Hermes relayer.

Japanese documentation is available in [README.ja.md](README.ja.md).

## What This Repository Contains

- `x/crossref`: Cosmos SDK module for domain registration, checkpoint storage, channel binding, cross-reference packet send/receive, ICS23 proof verification, and hysteresis signature verification.
- `proto/crossrefd/crossref/v1`: protobuf definitions for messages, queries, genesis state, packet data, and module types.
- `app`: application wiring for the `crossrefd` chain.
- `docker`: five isolated `crossrefd` chains plus one Hermes relayer.
- `docker/scripts/run-crossref-experiment.sh`: end-to-end experiment that opens a five-chain full mesh, submits checkpoints, collects ICS23 proofs, broadcasts packets, and verifies received cross-references.

## Architecture

The prototype models five domains:

- `chain-a`
- `chain-b`
- `chain-c`
- `chain-d`
- `chain-e`

Hermes opens pairwise `crossref/crossref` IBC channels for every unordered pair. This produces 10 pairwise channel connections and 20 directed cross-reference routes. Each source chain can submit its own checkpoint and broadcast that checkpoint to the other four chains.

The receiver validates:

1. the packet source domain matches the registered source chain;
2. the packet arrived through the authorized local channel;
3. the checkpoint hash is internally consistent;
4. the previous checkpoint hash matches the latest known checkpoint when applicable;
5. the source checkpoint exists on the source chain through an IBC light-client verified ICS23 store proof;
6. the hysteresis signature is valid when the source domain registered a hysteresis public key.

## Crossref Module

The module currently supports:

- `RegisterDomain`: register a domain ID, chain ID, validator set hash, metadata URI, and optional Ed25519 hysteresis public key.
- `BindDomainChannel`: bind a local domain and remote domain pair to an IBC port/channel.
- `SubmitCheckpoint`: store a local checkpoint after hash and optional hysteresis signature verification.
- `SendCrossReferencePacket`: send one checkpoint to a bound remote domain.
- `BroadcastCrossReferencePacket`: send one source checkpoint to all bound remote domains.
- `ReceiveCrossReferencePacket`: receive and verify a checkpoint packet, including ICS23 source-store proof validation.
- query endpoints for domains, channels, checkpoints, cross-references, and checkpoint proof export.

## Hysteresis Signature Verification

Domains may register an Ed25519 `hysteresis_public_key`.

When a domain has this key, both local checkpoint submission and IBC packet receive require `hysteresis_signature`. The signature is verified against the checkpoint hash. The checkpoint hash commits to the current block/app state and the previous checkpoint hash, so the checkpoint chain remains tamper-evident.

Domains without `hysteresis_public_key` are still accepted for local experiments and migration compatibility.

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux shell
- Go toolchain compatible with the generated Cosmos SDK app
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine with Docker Compose
- Internet access for Docker image pulls and Go dependency resolution when the module cache is empty

## Quick Start

From the repository root:

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o ./build/crossrefd-linux-arm64 ./cmd/crossrefdd
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
docker/scripts/run-crossref-experiment.sh
```

Success ends with:

```text
Five-chain cross-reference experiment passed.
```

For the detailed Docker experiment guide, see [docker/README.md](docker/README.md).

## Useful Commands

Run Go tests:

```bash
go test -count=1 ./...
```

Regenerate protobuf code:

```bash
make proto-gen
```

Start the five-chain Docker network:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

Run the full experiment:

```bash
docker/scripts/run-crossref-experiment.sh
```

Stop and remove chain state:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

## Local Endpoints

| Chain | RPC | gRPC | REST |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | `http://localhost:26657` | `localhost:9090` | `http://localhost:1317` |
| B | `http://localhost:26667` | `localhost:9091` | `http://localhost:1318` |
| C | `http://localhost:26677` | `localhost:9092` | `http://localhost:1319` |
| D | `http://localhost:26687` | `localhost:9093` | `http://localhost:1320` |
| E | `http://localhost:26697` | `localhost:9094` | `http://localhost:1321` |

## Current Prototype Scope

This repository is an experimental implementation. It is intended for local verification of the cross-reference design, IBC application behavior, proof validation, and multi-chain routing. Production hardening still needs additional work around operational key management, chain upgrade policy, full threat modeling, relayer operations, and a stricter hysteresis signature format if the exact paper definition `H(S_n-1)` must be represented separately from the checkpoint hash.
